    <h3>ABOUT OTP</h3>
    <p>Omaha Test Preparatory (OTP) is a student led organisation that looks forward to accelerating your child’s success in the future. With a highly talented and dedicated team, we will able to open your child to the standardised and advanced testing environment at an earlier time than the average public student. Your child will be exposed to whatever material you want them to (see “Materials” in the menu above). Our qualifications for our tutors can be seen below or accessed through the menu as well. With a surplus of enriched knowledge over ACT, PSAT/SAT, and Advanced Placement examinations, we only ask you for $25 USD for a one-on-one hour session with a free class every 5th session, or $15 USD in a group of 5 tutees or more.</p>
    <p style="font-style: italic;">“During my public education experience, stress and anxiety was an integral part of my testing environment. Now after taking Omaha Test Prep, I am much more confident when I walk into the test room.”</p>
    <p style="font-style: italic; text-align: right;">- Lucas Wang, OTP Participant</p>
