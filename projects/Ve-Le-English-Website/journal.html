        <h2>AFRICAN AMERICAN ART AND ITS MARGINALIZATION</h2><div id="notify"></div>
        <h5>1/17/2018</h5>
        <div id="hl"></div>
        <p style="text-indent: 6vw;">African art has been marginalized in schooling and in the artistic world. Schools often focus on the western concept of beauty and art and is very ethnocentric. Diverse students are often discouraged to try and create something that would go against the norm. I find it fascinating how we preach diversity and yet do not allow it in many institutions.</p>
        <p style="text-indent: 6vw;">On of many cases would be when an African American artist would get docked points on a class assignment because they drew a black Romeo and Juliet. The teacher stated that Romeo and Juliet were white, and the artist had drawn them incorrectly. It is unfair to not allow representation for African Americans that they do not often see. </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 6vw;">Furthermore, African art is marginalized in galleries and in the real world. Though there is already a cliche about how hard it is to make money as an artist, it was even harder for black people because they didn't even have a means of revealing their art to the public. They are told that their standards of beauty are incorrect because they focus on afro-centric features. Due to this racist ideology, African Americans were already put at a disadvantage. </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 6vw;">African American artists are and should be fed up with the treatment they receive. Thus, they focus on fighting back against the institutionalized oppression. Many incorporate activist messages into their art to promote diversity and tolerance.  Others come together to consolidate their art and this allows for the meaning of the art to be emphasized.</p>
        <p style="text-indent: 6vw; padding-bottom: 5vmin;">Angelou is an African American who has been oppressed over her lifetime. She focuses on what it means to be black and how it affects her and her community. Her tone and her ability to connect with her audience allow her to spread the message of her art. In this way, she can spread the idea that African Americans ARE good enough and deserve to be heard. </p>
